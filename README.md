## About San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity
Website: (https://sgvhabitat.org/)

Mission statement: Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities, and hope. We build strength and self-reliance through shelter.

## Project Introduction
San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity is a homeless housing nonprofit organization that relies on efficient survey automation and intutive data analysis to improve its outreach. Their current system lacks a complete, customizable, user friendly hub that quantifies impact, displays critical feedback, and merges existing data. Utilizing various Google services, we created a web application that will streamline SGVH's data collection and analysis.

## Technologies Used
| Technologies   | Usage |
| -------- | ------- |
| Microsoft Azure AI, Python| REST API, Computer Vision  |
| Looker Studio | Data Visualization |
| Google Forms    | User Surveys  |
| Google Sheets   | Database  |
| Google Sites    | Dashboard |


## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Looker Studio, Google Sites, Google Forms
- Backend: Google Sheets, Google Sites
- Database: Google Sheets
- APIs: Microsoft Azure API
<!-- Add/modify as needed -->

## Getting Started

```bash
# Example commands
git clone [your-repo-link]
cd [your-repo-name]
npm install
npm start
```

## Challenges
1. Our largest challenge was pivoting from a coding a full-stack web applicaiton to utilizing Google's integrated services. After talks with our community partner and project mentors, we targeted their needs by developing an accesssible, customizable, and dynamic application that is simple to maintain and understand. This also allowed us to focus on difficult background tools and maximize Google's free services.
2. SGVH has an overflow of existing survey paper and excel files that are uncentralized and discombobulated. To combat this, we developed a python script that utilizes computer vision and a LLM to read existing paper surveys and integrate them into a combined database. The two main issues we ran into was identifying circled multiple-choice questions on the survey and retrieving consistent data from our LLM
3. Due to the nature of free-response forms, it was difficult to consolidate consistent data between our network of platforms. Before creating visuals on Looker Studio, we combined existing paper surveys and new online surveys into one main database while sectioning off the different survey responses. However, between reading multiple data inputs and the limits of the Google services, maintaining multiple databases which funneled into our visual dataset was a challenge.

## Future Enhancements and Plans (NOT DONEEE)
1. Fully developing a scan
2. Scraping Google Sites
3. Ideas for tools
