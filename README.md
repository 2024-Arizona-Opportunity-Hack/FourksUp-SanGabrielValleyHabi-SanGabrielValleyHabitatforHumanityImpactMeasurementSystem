## About San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity
Website: (https://sgvhabitat.org/)
Mission statement: Seeking to put God's love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities, and hope. We build strength and self-reliance through shelter.

## Project Introduction
San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity is a homeless housing nonprofit organization that relies on efficient survey automation and intutive data analysis to improve its outreach. Their current system lacks a complete, customizable, user friendly hub that quantifies impact, displays critical feedback, and merges existing data. Utilizing various Google services, we created a web application that will streamline SGVH's data analysis services and outreach.
